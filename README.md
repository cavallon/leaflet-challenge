# Leaflet for Earthquake Visualization

# Summary

This project involves visualizing earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to educate the public and government organizations about global seismic activity. By utilizing Leaflet and D3.js, the project aims to create interactive maps displaying earthquake magnitude and depth, along with providing additional information through popups and legends. 

The completed code file is found in Leaflet-Part-1. 

I did not find it necessary to upload any files to Leaflet-Part-2.
